# Test-Project
Hi I'm Jiao,
this is my project for CodeLouisville,
For now it is only breif introduction to me.
The initial popup collect the username (example as Harry Potter), then uses the name in the welcome message
The main contents are in separate divs and each block is floated when viewing on laptop
the content blocks, upon viewing on cell phone, will align vertically
